FTA Thumb Drive Project

This project is to create an .bat file to run on the FIRST Robotics Competition's Driver Station.
The program will in turn do the following:
  1.  Set the Wired NIC to DHCP
  2.  Set the firewall to off
  3.  Disable the Wireless NIC
  4.  Restart the Wired NIC
  5.  Restart the mDNS Servie
  
This program is to help FTAs and CSA set the Driver Stations to be able to communicate with the FMS while on the field
or get them ready before the competion begins.

Note:  You will need to run the program as an adminstrator to disable the firewall.
